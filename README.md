1. **Analysis of a simply supported beam subjected to any arbitrary general loading:**
   Let a simply supported beam of length $L$ be subjected to any arbitrary general loading $w(x)$, as shown in Figure 1. The loading function $w(x)$ can be represented by the Fourier series of harmonic loading functions of periodicity equal to $2L$ as  
$$w(x)=\dfrac{a_0}{2}+\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\cos \dfrac{n\pi x}{L}+\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\sin \dfrac{n\pi x}{L} $$
